# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-System
I developed this project using Python. Handwritten Character Recognition with Python allows the computer to turn handwriting into a readable format. It is a field of research in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition and is used to recognize text inside images, such as scanned documents and photos.
